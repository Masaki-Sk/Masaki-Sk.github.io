<h4>【Overview】</h4>
<p>
There was a shared awareness within our team of the issue that friendships tended to be concentrated within one’s own academic department.
</p>
<p>
The root cause of this was that most opportunities to interact at school came through classes, and even extracurricular events were typically related to the student’s department.
</p>
<p>
The solution we aimed for was to create a “space” where people could engage with a broader range of individuals.
</p>
<p>
The “Manoa Connect” project was launched to enable the formation of cross-departmental friendships through a chat application featuring high-randomness matching.
</p>
<p>
First, let me clarify what a design pattern actually is. Imagine you are tasked with creating a new software module. Which is easier: designing it completely from the ground up, or improving upon a pre-existing, well-established model? A design pattern provides this kind of foundational model — a reusable template for solving common design problems. In more abstract terms, a design pattern is a "building block of design," offering a standardized way to manage responsibilities and interactions between objects.

  Manoa Connect includes the following features:
  <ul>
    <li>Homepage</li>
    <li>Profile editing page</li>
    <li>Schedule editing page</li>
    <li>Chat page</li>
    <li>Matching page</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>【My Role】</h4>
<p>
I was in charge of the chat page. Using note functions and state management, I implemented real-time chat functionality.
</p>

<h4>【Community Feedback】</h4>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some users may not want to share their profiles, so information disclosure should be limited before matching.</li>
    <li>Supporting smartphone usage would make the app more accessible to a wider audience.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>【Developers】</h4>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Aaron Ramos</li>
    <li>Masaki Sakai</li>
    <li>Chaezen-Lee Pebria</li>
    <li>Codie Nakamura</li>
  </ul>
