I aspire to leverage my expertise to make a profound and widespread impact on the world. Here, I will clarify the origins of my journey as an engineer and the vision I aim to achieve.

Encounter with IT
My introduction to IT came through the "Development Cooperation Theory" course at Waseda University. In this course, I learned how smartphones are being utilized in Africa and how AI is being used to diagnose diseases. While the course focused on supporting developing countries, my interest was drawn toward the potential applications of AI. This experience fueled my aspiration to contribute to the ongoing global IT revolution, leading me to pursue a major in Computer Science.

Interest in the Stock Market
Through my long-term internship as an equity analyst, I developed deep respect for my supervisors and senior colleagues, who demonstrated sharp analytical skills, including insights into foreign markets and an unwavering commitment to financial indicators. Additionally, I was captivated by the ability of a single research report to significantly influence stock prices, highlighting the value an analyst can bring to a company. Building on this experience, I aspire to become an analyst who conveys the appeal of the Japanese market to a diverse range of global investors, thereby stimulating market activity and contributing broadly to Japan’s economic landscape. Moreover, I believe that my background in computer science allows me to fully realize my potential as a quantitative analyst.

Future Outlook
To establish myself as a quantitative analyst in Japan’s securities market, I am currently studying algorithm optimization and system interface design at the University of Hawaii. By exploring what makes an interface intuitive and user-friendly, as well as the algorithms that drive optimal decision-making, I aim to build a strong foundation for my future career.

My goal is to integrate IT and finance to create a career that inspires confidence and amazement on a global scale. As a first step, I am committed to applying my knowledge to practical work and making meaningful contributions to society.
