I fully support the adoption of coding standards to enhance conde readability among developers.

A coding standard defines a structured approach to writing code, ensuring consistency and improving readability for peers. However adhering to these standards can sometimes feel restrictive, as ESLint may flag errors even when the code functions correctly.

When I first wrote TypeScript code with ESLint, I encountered several warnings, including: 

・Expected indentation of 2 spaces but found

・Newline required at end of file but not found

・Unexpected space before function parentheses

・More than one blank line not allowed

Initially, after installing ESLint, my code was flooded with warnings, which I found frustrating.

However, what if coding standards didn't exist? Modern programming languages offer great flexibility, allowing developers to write code in vastly different styles. For example, some programmers place parentheses on a new line, while others do not. This flexibility, while powerful, can lead to inconsistent code that is functionally identical but visually disparate, making it harder to read and maintain.

To improve code readability, across teams, I firmly believe that adhering to coding standards should be mandatory. Standardized code allows developers to quickly understand each other's work, reducing confusion, minimizing stress, and ultimately boosting development productivity.
