<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
In <a href = "http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to Ask Questions the Smart Way</a>, Eric Raymond emphasizes that asking smart questions is essential for hackers to learn from experienced developers and improve their skills efficiently. Among the key aspects of smart questioning, "who to ask" and "what to ask" play crucial roles. This essay examines examples of both smart questions and not-so-smart questions posted on Stack Overflow, analyzing their characteristics to clarify how to ask effective questions.
</p>

<h4>Example of a Smart Question</h4>
<h6>Question: Where is the Python documentation for the special methods? (init, new, len, ...)</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Views: 33K in 4 days</li>
  <li>Answers: 8</li>
</ul>
<p>
This question asks about the location of official Python documentation for special methods. Since many Python developers frequently use special methods, the question garnered widespread interest, leading to numerous views and responses.
</p>

<h6>Example of a Not-So-Smart Question</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Views: 26 in 6 days</li>
  <li>Answers: 0</li>
</ul>
<p>
This question inquires about the necessity of initializing a model class in a Python MVC application. However, it has very few views and has received no responses.
</p>

<h4>Who to Ask</h4>
<p>
In the smart question, the question about Python special methods is relevant to all Python developers, making it more likely to attract interest and receive responses. In the not-so-smart question, the MVC app-related question targets a more specific audience, which makes it less engaging for the general public and harder to get answers. To attract more responses, it is beneficial to ask questions that cover broad topics and appeal to a wider audience.
</p>

<h4>What to Ask</h4>
<p>
It is also crucial to consider whether the question offers an opportunity for the respondent to expand their own knowledge. In the smart question, the question about special method documentation can prompt even knowledgeable developers to revisit and explore new special methods or refine their understanding of their usage. In the not-so-smart question, the MVC model initialization question is confined to a narrow topic, lacks broad applicability, and fails to capture the interest of potential respondents. Of course, even a not-so-smart question may be insightful in the right context. However, on Stack Overflow, questions that not only capture public interest but also provide value to respondents are more likely to receive answers.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
When asking questions, it is essential to carefully consider "who to ask" and "what to ask". On Stack Overflow, questions that are broadly relevant and thought-provoking for experts tend to receive more responses. This principle extends beyond Stack Overflowâ€”it applies to all forms of questioning. In any setting, considering what makes a question compelling and worth answering is key to effective communication.
