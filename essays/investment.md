In Japan, the proportion of investment funds within financial assets remains lower compared to the U.S. and Europe. To address this, the government is encouraging individual investments to stimulate economic growth. However, can ordinary people without financial knowledge truly understand interest rate fluctuations, financial statement analysis, or even quantitative analysis? From the perspective of a securities firm, I am interested in learning about optimization, AI prediction, and speech recognition to assist individuals in making data-driven investment decisions.

First, optimization through programming can significantly improve individual investment portfolios. By considering a vast number of variables, it calculates risk and return, determining the optimal allocation of assets. This allows working individuals to adjust their portfolio strategies in real time, down to the second.

Next, AI predictions enhance the accuracy of technical analysis. Currently, due to the sheer number of variables and influencing factors, technical analysis is beyond the capabilities of individual investors. By aggregating massive amounts of market data, AI can accurately identify bottoms and peaks, making precise predictions that would otherwise be impossible for humans.

Finally, speech recognition can improve the analysis of earnings announcements. Many people sense fluctuations in the confidence of presenters during earnings calls, but relying on intuition alone is risky. By leveraging extensive speech recognition data, we can analyze the behavior of executives as an additional indicator, ultimately leading to more precise financial analysis.
